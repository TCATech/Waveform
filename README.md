# FAQ

**Q:** Why are you recoding Musicful? <br />
**A:** We want to start from scratch, instead of using an edited version of [Musicium](https://github.com/Tomato6966/Musicium). <br /> <br />

**Q:** Is it going to be similar, if not the same as version 1? <br />
**A:** We are going to try and make it as similar as version 1, but since we want to move away from Musicium, most of it will be different. <br /> <br />

**Q:** What features *might* get removed? <br />
**A:** Filters. And that's about it. <br /> <br />

**Q:** What features do you plan on adding that other music bots don't have? <br />
**A:** Being able to play a song that someone is listening to on Spotify, and a customizable per-user favorites playlist.
